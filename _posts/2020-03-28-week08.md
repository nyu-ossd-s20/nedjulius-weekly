title: "Week 8: Starting off with a final project"
---

After some hassle, I and my group finally decided on our final open-source project. We decided to work on a project by Processing, [p5js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js). It is a well known JavaScript library that makes it easier for designers, educators, and anyone to code, animate, teach and do a lot of other stuff in JavaScript. 

Before we finalized our decision, we had a lot of other projects in mind, such as **OpenFoodFacts** or **Firefox Voice**. We also thought about choosing some new projects related to the COVID-19 pandemic. One of our main goals was to contribute to something meaningful. However, most of these new projects related to the COVID-19 pandemic have an uncertain future, and other criteria for contribution is the longevity of the project.

P5js seemed like a good choice. It has a very friendly community, the project is widely used and is certainly meaningful. We also found some issues that we could work on, and the main contributors were extremely responsive. I think we made a good choice and we already have some tasks to do (translation, adding examples to the new website, inline documentation, typos).

Overall, I think we made a good choice and I can't wait to make my first contribution!
