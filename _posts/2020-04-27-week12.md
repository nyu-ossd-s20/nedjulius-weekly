title: "Week 12: open-source business models and final project"
---

This week we spoke about open-source business models, and I also made bunch of contributions to our final project. As of now, I am really enjoying the open-source community and my involvement in one of the open-source projects.

In the class, we had an opportunity to talk about business models that involve open-source development. I have heard about some of this before, and I know that some of the companies employ the kind of open-source development model in designing their products. However, I never thought that business might use open-source community to their advantage. I've heard these ideas first when listening to the talk by Gil Yehuda, and last week we received more information on the subject, presented by prof. Joanna.

Regarding our final project, I think everything is going very nice. As we filled out our contribution table, it seems that we managed to make so many contributions. But of course, the most important thing is not quantity, but quality. For the past couple of weeks, I've been working on one bug fix that I spoke about in my last post. It's the cache-busting fix, which makes the browser load the latest version of the file instead of retrieving the cached version when the website is accessed. I finally finished this bugfix, and although it took me some time, I learned a great deal, and I also feel that I added something that is quite important.
