title: "Week 11: becoming part of the p5.js community"
---

This week, I've started working on a cache-busting solution for **p5.js** website, and I can proudly say that I feel like I'm part of their community now.

The cache-busting problem that I was talking about happens when the name of some file does not change after updates, and browsers cache the old files. To overcome this, the solution is to somehow generate a version string that will be changed and added to the name of the edited file if there were any changes detected. The solution that I am working on involves using a SHA256 hash. I will hash the files that need to be watched, and return the hash string as a version string. If there are no changes, then the version string will remain the same. Otherwise, the browser will load up the new file.

I also feel like I can help others to contribute too at this point. I have written a few messages under the issues, suggesting what could be done to solve that particular issue. I feel like I know the project pretty well at the moment, and the current task that I'm working on will help my understanding even more.

The only thing that I'm slacking for this course at the moment is personal contributions. For the past few weeks, I didn't have much time to research something that I could contribute to personally, but I will try to work on this during the last weeks.
