title: "Week 13: final projects"
---

This week was unofficially my last week in the class as tomorrow we are starting the final project presentations. This week, however, we only happened to have one class and in terms of OSSD it was really **chill**. My group is actually presenting tomorrow, so I am very excited to share my experience on working with **p5js** with the class. I think our final project went really well, we managed to do a lot of contributions and we really got involved into the community.

I am also excited to see what others have done and where do we stand in the class. Overall, I really enjoyed the course and it's format. I really felt, that this exam-free type of learning was also pressure-free and it was very easy to enjoy this class. I've learned a great deal about open-source development, but the most important thing is that I finally got involved in it myself. It always seemed really difficult, almost impossible to do for me due to the complicated projects and etc., but in this class I learned that the vision and motivation for contributing is more important than coding knowledge. You learn as you go, and when you have proper motivation, I think it's easier to learn and understand stuff. Big thumbs up for now!
