Some information about you!

### More Information

I am Julius Nedzinskas, a second-year Computer Science student at NYU. I was born and grew up in Vilnius, Lithuania. Out of all Computer Science related fields, I find the most enjoyment in Web Development. Besides being a CS major, I am also interested in Psychology. In my freetime I love to explore New York City (especially its pizzerias), dig for some unheard techno or disco tunes online, read books, listen Lithuanian podcasts (so I don't forget my native language), play sports (predominantly basketball), or just simply do whatever (I think doing nothing productive sometimes is also important, as nowadays people tend to overwork).
